## Experience

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>Senior Engineer, GlobalFoundries</span> <span>May 2020 -- Nov 2020</span><span>Aug 2022 -- Present</span>

Physical rules and software solutions team. This team provides yield-improving design for manufacturing solutions, and works on software solutions to automate the design enablement process of GlobalFoundries.

 - Accomplished innovation projects as measured by new engineering products and delivering three publications at industry-leading Silicon Valley conferences (SPIE and Cadence Live).
 - Led machine learning project that is better than traditional workflows for yield-improving algorithms.
 - Derived new patterns for our software decks to improve the yield of customers.
 - Integration of DFM software in all major electronic design automation tool vendors Calibre, Synopsys and Cadence.
 - Extensive software testing to find problematic code and solutions.
 - **Skills: Linux, Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas, Calibre, SynopsysICV, Cadence, Documentation, Version Control, Software Testing**

### <span>Machine Learning Researcher, Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society</span> <span>May 2021 -- July 2022</span>

Part of a PhD program to use equivariant graph neural networks for the study of phase transitions and the corrugated potential energy surface of perovskites and liquid silicon phase transition dynamics

 - Developed my own Python package to study molecular dynamics data to perform complicated geometrical operations, time series analysis, and optimization. Code was developed using team feedback.
 - My software and workflow aided my teammates projects by providing machine learned data.
 - Extensive automation and streamlining of data analytics code for model creation, inference and testing.
